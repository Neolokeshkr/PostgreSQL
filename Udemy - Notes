Operators in Postgres:
	+,-,*,/,^,@

String Operators and Fuunctions:

	|| - Join two strings
		=# SELECT 'Lokesh'||' '||'Kumar' AS NAME;
	CONCAT() - Join two Strings 
		=# SELECT CONCAT('Lokesh ','Kumar');
	LOWER() - Gives a lower case string
		=# SELECT LOWER('LOKESH KUMAR');
	LENGTH() - Gives length of the string
		=# SELECT LENGTH('LOKESH KUMAR');
	UPPER() - Gives a lower case string
		=# SELECT UPPER('lokesh kumar');

Comparison Math Operators:
	
	BETWEEN - Is the value between other two values?
		=# SELECT * FROM table WHERE column BETWEEN val1 AND val2;
	NOT IN - Is the value NOT present in a list?
		=# SELECT name FROM table WHERE name NOT IN ('listItem1','listItem2', ...);

	IN - Is the value present in the list?
		=# SELECT name FROM table WHERE name IN ('listItem1','listItem2', ...);
	
Relationships in Databases:

	1. One to Many Relationship
		-Always look for "has many" in a relationship.
		Eg 1. A facebook user has many photos.

	2. Many to One relationship
		Eg : 1. Various photos belong to a single user.

	3. One to One relationship
		Eg 	1. Ship <----> Captain
			2. Company <---> CEO
			3. Person <---> Driving License

	4. Many to Many Relationships;
		Eg	1. Students <---> Classes
			2. Movies <---> Actors

Keys in PostgreSQL:

	1. Primary Key : Uniquely identify a single record in a table.
		Eg : 	CREATE TABLE users (
				id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
				username VARCHAR(50) 
			);
	
	2. Foreign Key : Identifies a record usually in another table.
		Eg :	CREATE TABLE photos(
				id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
				url VARCHAR(200),
				user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users_udemy(id))
			);
	
	3. Join Query:
		Eg : SELECT * FROM users JOIN photos ON users.id = photos.user_id;
	
	4. DELETE Keyword
		Eg: 	DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1;
		
		On Delete Options (when a user is deleted):
		1. ON DELETE RESTRICT 	- Default Option|Throws Error
		2. ON DELETE NO ACTION 	- Throws Error

		3. ON DELETE CASCADE	- Deletes the photos too.
			Eg : 	CREATE TABLE photos_udemy (
					id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
					url VARCHAR(200),
					user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users_udemy(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
				);

		4. ON DELETE SET NULL	- Set user_id of photo to null
			Eg : 	CREATE TABLE photos_udemy (
					id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
					url VARCHAR(200),
					user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users_udemy(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
		);

		5. ON DELETE SET DEFAULT- Set user_id of photo to a default value,(if provided).
